This project mentioned was a research study conducted by BusinessFinancing.co.uk to identify the oldest company that was still in business in almost every country in the world. Our team conducted this project to explore the characteristics that enable a business to stand the test of time.

To accomplish this, we researched the oldest company in each country and compiled the results into a dataset. The dataset can be found in the datasets directory and contains information such as the name of the company, its industry, location, and the year it was established.

Through this project, we aimed to gain a better understanding of these historic businesses and what has contributed to their longevity. By studying these businesses, we were able to gain insights into factors such as strong leadership, adaptability, and a focus on innovation that contributed to their success over time.

This project shed light on the importance of understanding the characteristics of successful long-standing businesses and how they can inform modern business practices.
